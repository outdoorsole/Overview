     UIWindow: The backdrop for your app's user interface and the object that dispatches events to the views.
     https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiwindow
     
     Windows work with view controllers to handle events and perform many other tasks that are important to app's operation
     
     UIKit handles most window-related interactions, working with other objects as needed to implement many app behaviors
     
     When to use windows:
        - Provide a main window to display your app's content
        - Create additional windows (as needed) to display additional content
    */

    
    /*
     Storyboards require the presence of a window property on the app delegate object (as shown here)
     (automatically provided by Xcode)
     */
    
    
    /*
     UIWindow for a handful of other tasks:
        - settting the z-axis level of window (affects the visibility of window relative to other windows)
        - showing windows and making them the target of keyboard events
        - converting coordinate values to and from the window's coordinate system
        - changing the root view controller of a window
        - changing the screen on which the window is displayed
     
     UIWindows do not have a visual appearance of their own
     
     window is a HOST of one or more views (these are managed by the window's root view controller)
     configure the root view controller in storyboards
     
     It is RARE that you need to subclass UIWindow.
     
     custom behaviors when a window's key status changes
        becomeKey(): called automatically to inform the window that it has become the key window
        resignKey(): called automatically to inform the window that it is no longer the key window
    */
